Overview
========

This fork add ability to use xhgui as docker container
Just use ```docker pull duhon/xhgui``` and ```docker pull mongo``` for link mongo to xhgui
Or use docker-compose approach:

````xml
version: '3.2'
services:
  app:
    image: _YOUR_APP_
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
  xhgui:
    image: duhon/xhgui
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8088:80"
````

For pass data from tideways to xhgui just add **tideways.ini** to your Application


Below you can find default docs:

How To Run
==========

1. Clone this repo to your oms folder on your host machine;
2. Make sure you have installed tideways php extension on your vagrant box. If you haven't - go to [tideways extension](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension) and install it;
    * Note, for our current vagrant box (OMS721) you might need to install `autoconf` to be able to install tideways extension. Check "Install autoconf for OMS721" below to do that.
    * Note, for vagrant box that we use for OMS this step is automated with puppet. Check if file `/home/vagrant/php-xhprof-extension/modules/tideways_xhprof.so` exists inside a box. If not - run `vagrant provision`.
3. Go to php.ini file and add below configuration for tideways;
    ```ini
       [tideways]
       extension="/path/to/tideways/tideways.so"
       tideways.connection=unix:///usr/local/var/run/tidewaysd.sock
       tideways.load_library=0
       tideways.auto_prepend_library=0
       tideways.auto_start=0
       tideways.sample_rate=100
    ```
4. Restart php-fpm and apache;
5. Make sure you have installed docker on your host machine. If not - go to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and install it;
6. Make sure you have installed docker-compose on your host machine. If not - go to [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and install it;
7. Go to your xhgui folder on your host machine;
8. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start containers;
9. Your xhgui web interface must be available on [http://0.0.0.0:8088](http://0.0.0.0:8088)
10. Your xhgui api interface must be visible from inside a vagrant box on `http://10.0.2.2:8088/api.php`;
    * If xhgui api url is different from `http://10.0.2.2:8088/api.php` - go to `external/header.php` file and update const `PATH_TO_XHGUI_API` with a proper value.
11. To enable profiling you need manually include `external/header.php` file to a php script that you want to profile;
    * Add `include "/platform/svc/app/oms/xhgui/external/header.php";` to `backoffice/web/app_dev.php` to profile backoffice;
    * Add `include "/platform/svc/app/oms/xhgui/external/header.php";` to `oms/web/app.php` to profile oms;
    * Add `include "/platform/svc/app/oms/xhgui/external/header.php";` to `oms/app/console` to profile console commands;
    * Add `include "/platform/svc/app/oms/xhgui/external/header.php";` to `oms/app/job-console.php` to profile cron jobs;
12. Run your application and check results on xhgui web interface.

xhgui
=====

A graphical interface for XHProf data built on MongoDB.

This tool requires that [Tideways](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension) are installed.
Tideways is a PHP Extension that records and provides profiling data.
XHGui (this tool) takes that information, saves it in MongoDB, and provides
a convenient GUI for working with it.

Using Tideways Extension
========================

The XHProf PHP extension is not compatible with PHP7.0+. Instead you'll need to
use the [tideways extension](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension).

Once installed, you can use the following configuration data:

```ini
[tideways]
extension=tideways_xhprof.so
tideways.connection=unix:///usr/local/var/run/tidewaysd.sock
tideways.load_library=0
tideways.auto_prepend_library=0
tideways.auto_start=0
tideways.sample_rate=100
```

Install autoconf for OMS721
=======
```bash
sudo yum install -y m4
sudo yum install -y perl-Data-Dumper.x86_64

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
gunzip autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
tar xvf autoconf-2.69.tar
cd autoconf-2.69
./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

Add indexes to MongoDB
=======
```bash
$ mongo
> use xhprof
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.SERVER.REQUEST_TIME' : -1 } )
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().wt' : -1 } )
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().mu' : -1 } )
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().cpu' : -1 } )
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.url' : 1 } )
> db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.simple_url' : 1 } )
```
